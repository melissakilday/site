## 📝 Code Standards

### General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing
- Use CSS custom properties for repeated values

### Images

- **Optimization System**: Use local WebP format with JPEG fallbacks
- **Format**: WebP primary (60%+ size reduction), JPEG for compatibility
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive, SEO-optimized alt text required for all images
- **Responsive**: 7 breakpoint sizes (320px-1920px)
- **Tools**: Sharp library for conversion, custom optimization scripts
- **Gallery**: WebP format in `/images/forgallery/` with eager loading
