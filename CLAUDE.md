## Recent Major Improvements (August 24, 2024)

### ✅ Gallery System Complete Overhaul
**Status:** FULLY COMPLETED ✅

**Key Achievements:**
- Fixed critical black squares display issue (PNG files incorrectly named as .webp)

- Background scroll lock when lightbox is active

### ✅ Homepage 404 Error Fix
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅

**Issue:** Homepage trying to load non-existent `/images/optimized/hero-background_1920.webp`
**Fix:** Updated to correct filename `hero-background_1920q80.webp` with quality suffix

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅

**Improvements:**

## Image Optimization System

### WebP Gallery Images
Located in `/public/images/forgallery/`:
- 16 high-quality WebP images
- 60-95% smaller than PNG equivalents
- Example: `balayage-transformation.png` (2.2MB) → `.webp` (102KB)

### Optimized Images System
Located in `/public/images/optimized/`:
- 304 total files (152 WebP + 152 JPEG fallbacks)
- 7 responsive breakpoints per image (320px-1920px)
- Quality variants (q80 for WebP, q85 for JPEG)
- Naming convention: `[name]_[width]q[quality].[ext]`

## Technical Architecture

### Build Configuration
```bash
# Development
npm run dev        # Start dev server on localhost:4321

# Production Build
npm run build      # ~45-70 seconds for all 38 pages

# Quality Checks
npm run lint       # ESLint checks
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript validation
```

### Gallery Implementation
```javascript
// Gallery structure with SEO-optimized alt text
const galleryImages = [
  {
    src: "/images/forgallery/balayage-transformation.webp",
    alt: "Beautiful balayage transformation with natural-looking highlights"
  },
  // ... 16 total images
];
```

### Lightbox Features

- Keyboard support (ESC, ←, →)
- Touch swipe gestures for mobile
- Image counter display
- Smooth fade animations

## Performance Metrics

### Core Web Vitals
- **LCP:** Optimized with WebP images and eager loading for critical images
- **CLS:** Fixed aspect ratios prevent layout shifts
- **FID:** Minimal JavaScript, optimized event handlers

### Image Performance
- **WebP Benefits:** 60-95% file size reduction
- **Loading Strategy:** Eager for above-fold, lazy for below-fold
- **Fallback Support:** JPEG alternatives for older browsers

## SEO Optimizations

### Image SEO
- ✅ Descriptive alt text with keywords on all images

- **Solution:** Renamed files and converted to true WebP format
- **Prevention:** Verify file formats match extensions

#### Homepage 404 Error (RESOLVED)
- **Cause:** Missing quality suffix in image filename
- **Solution:** Updated to include q80/q85 suffixes

## Development Guidelines

### Image Handling
1. Always verify file format matches extension
2. Use WebP for gallery images (better compression)
3. Provide JPEG fallbacks for compatibility
4. Include descriptive, keyword-rich alt text
5. Test on slow connections and older devices

### Code Quality
1. Run `npm run build` before committing
2. Verify no 404 errors in browser console
3. Test responsive layouts on multiple devices
4. Ensure all images have proper alt text
5. Check Core Web Vitals scores

## Next Planned Enhancements
- Consider adding image lazy loading for below-fold gallery items
- Implement image preloading for next/previous in lightbox
- Add social sharing buttons for gallery images
- Consider AVIF format for even better compression
- Add breadcrumb navigation for better SEO

## Emergency Procedures

### If Gallery Shows Black Squares
1. Check browser console for 404 errors
2. Verify file extensions match actual format: `file [filename]`
3. Ensure images are in `/public/images/forgallery/`
4. Clear browser cache and restart dev server

### If Build Fails
1. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies
2. Delete `.astro` and `dist` folders
3. Run `npm run build` again
4. Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run typecheck`

### Performance Issues
1. Check image sizes - should be WebP format
2. Verify lazy loading is working (IntersectionObserver)
3. Use browser DevTools Network tab to identify slow resources
4. Consider reducing image quality if files still too large
