  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Maintain your beautiful color with our permanent tint and touch-up service. Perfect for covering new growth, gray hair, or maintaining your existing shade, this service focuses on the root area to seamlessly blend with your current color. It's the ideal maintenance solution between full color applications, keeping you looking polished and put-together.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Root Touch-Ups</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Root touch-ups are essential for maintaining colored hair, typically needed every 4-6 weeks as your natural hair grows. This service applies permanent color to the new growth area (usually 1-2 inches from the scalp), perfectly matching your existing color for an undetectable blend. It's a quick, efficient way to keep your color looking fresh without processing your entire head.
