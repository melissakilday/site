  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Keratin Treatments: Your Gateway to Effortless Hair</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Keratin treatment is a revolutionary semi-permanent hair smoothing process that works by replenishing the hair's natural protein structure. Over time, factors like heat styling, chemical processing, environmental damage, and daily wear can deplete your hair's keratin levels, leading to porosity, frizz, and unmanageability. Our professional treatment fills these gaps by applying a keratin formula that penetrates deep into the hair shaft, then sealing it with controlled heat application.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    This scientifically-proven process smooths the hair cuticle at a molecular level, creating a protective barrier that locks out humidity while locking in moisture and shine. The result is hair that responds better to styling, maintains its shape longer, and feels noticeably softer and more manageable. Unlike chemical relaxers that break down hair bonds, keratin treatments strengthen and restore your hair's natural structure.
  </p>
