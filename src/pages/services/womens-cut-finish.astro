  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Perfect Cut for Your Face Shape</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Understanding face shapes is crucial for creating the most flattering haircut. Melissa's expertise in facial analysis ensures your cut enhances your best features:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Oval faces:</strong> Nearly any style works, from pixie cuts to long layers</li>
    <li><strong>Round faces:</strong> Longer styles with height at the crown create elongation</li>
    <li><strong>Square faces:</strong> Soft layers and side-swept bangs soften angular features</li>
    <li><strong>Heart faces:</strong> Chin-length bobs and side parts balance proportions</li>
    <li><strong>Long faces:</strong> Bangs and width-adding layers create balance</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="bg-[#FFDEE2] bg-opacity-20 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
    <h4 class="font-semibold mb-3">Keep Your Cut Looking Fresh:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
      <li>Schedule trims every 6-8 weeks to maintain your style's shape</li>
      <li>Use recommended products for your specific hair type</li>
      <li>Follow Melissa's personalized styling techniques</li>
      <li>Protect your hair with heat protectant before styling</li>
      <li>Sleep on a silk pillowcase to reduce friction and maintain style</li>
      <li>Deep condition weekly to keep hair healthy between visits</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Our Cuts Stand Out</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Melissa's approach to cutting goes beyond technical skill. She considers your hair's natural texture, growth patterns, and density to create a cut that works with your hair, not against it. This means easier styling, better grow-out, and a cut that looks great even on those rushed mornings.
